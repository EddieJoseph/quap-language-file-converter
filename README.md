#Quap Language File Converter
This is a project to convert the language input files for the QUAP 
component of [HealthCheck](https://github.com/digio-ch/pbs-healthcheck-web).

The project enables the language files to be edited in csv format with excel.
The csv files placed in the input directory can then be converted to json configuration files used by the HealthCheck.
